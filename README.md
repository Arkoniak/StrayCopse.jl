# Installation

This package is unregistered yet, so you should use dev version. To add `master`
version switch julia to `pkg` mode by pressing `]` and enter
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/Arkoniak/StrayCopses.jl.git
```

# Motivation

Currently this is a toy project, so API can be unstable, very unfriendly and so on.
There are two ideas that I want to try in this package

1. Push calculation speed as much as possible
2. Use it as a test-bed for various random forest techniques that currently are scattered in various
papers and narrow implementations.
